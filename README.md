# flag-icons

> A curated collection of all country flags in SVG â€” plus the CSS for easier integration.

## Usage

For using the flags inline with text add the classes `.fi` and `.fi-xx` (where `xx` is the [ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) of a country) to an empty `<span>`. If you want to have a squared version flag then add the class `fis` as well. Example:

```html
<span class="fi fi-gr"></span> <span class="fi fi-gr fis"></span>
```

You could also apply this to any element, but in that case you'll have to use the `fib` instead of `fi` and you're set. This will add the correct background with the following CSS properties:

```css
background-size: contain;
background-position: 50%;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```
